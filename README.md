# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Overview 
The goal of this project was to take earthquake data from the last 7 days and use `Javascript`, `HTML`, `Leaflet`, and `Mapbox` to present the data in a neat and interactive map. This map allows users to select between different map styles and turn on/off different map layers such as Major Earthquakes and Tectonic Plates. 

Example of how the map will look when presented to the user: <br> <br> ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60283799/184034978-be6dd8ea-c674-41f8-8367-f380abff10ec.png)
